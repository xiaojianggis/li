    <p align="justify" class="STYLE5">
      Xiaojiang is a tenure-track assistant professor at Department of Geography and Urban Studies, Temple University, PA. He was a Postdoctoral Fellow at MIT Senseable City Lab. His current research focuses on developing and applying geospatial analyses and data-driven approaches in the domain of urban studies. He has proposed to use Google Street View and machine learning for urban environmental studies and developed the Treepedia project, which aims mapping street greenery for cities around the world. He is also working on using human trace data to study human activities and investigate the connection between urban environments and human activities. Before that, he did his Ph.D. in Department of Geography, University of Connecticut.
      
      His research interests include GIScience, data-driven urban environment modeling, mobility and travel behavior profiling, urban computing and spatial analyses, and remote sensing. His research aims to provide a better understanding of human and urban environment systems and how geospatial data and computing could benefit human society. His work has been featured in popular media outlets, including <i>TIME</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, <i>Atlantic-Citylab</i>, <i>Associated Press</i>, and <i>MIT News</i>.
