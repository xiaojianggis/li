    		 As cities around the world race to implement green canopy strategies, we have developed a metric - the Green View Index - by which to evaluate and compare canopy cover. The Green View Index (GVI) was calculated using Google Street View (GSV) panoramas. This method considers the obstruction of tree canopies and classifies the images accordingly. By using GSV rather than satellite imagery, we represent human perception of the environment from the street level.<br>

    	<p align="justify">Streets are the basic unit for human activities in cities, it is important to understand how the streetscape environment can influence human health conditions. In this study, we investigated the influence of street greenery and walkability on body mass index in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Different from the area level and overhead view greenery metrics, we used the green view index calculated from the Google Street View to represent the amount of street greenery. The Walk Score was used to indicate the walkability of neighborhoods also at the street level. Statistical analysis results show that the Walk Score has a more significant association with decreased BMI for males than females and the street greenery has a more significant association with decreased BMI for females than males in Cleveland, Ohio. The results of this study would provide a reference for designing gender-specific healthy cities.</p>

    	<p align="justify">Having an active lifestyle is recognized to positively contribute to public health. Creating more walkable streets and neighborhoods is an important way to promote an active lifestyle for urban residents. It is therefore important to understand how the urban built environment can influence human walking activities. In this study, we investigated the interaction of human walking activities and physical characteristics of streetscapes in Boston. A large number of anonymous pedestrian trajectories collected from a smartphone application were used to estimate human walking activities. Publicly accessible Google Street View images were used to estimate the amount of the street greenery and enclosure of street canyons, both of which were used to indicate the physical characteristics of streetscapes.</p>

Citizens interact with the urban environment through its streetscape and it is imperative to, not only map city streetscapes but quantify those interactions in terms of human well-being. Google Street View (GSV), which captures the profile view of streetscapes and, thus, shares equivalent viewing angles with those of the citizen. Based on machine learning and image analysis, GSV can be utilized as a high-quality data source for mapping street greenery and openness. </p>
